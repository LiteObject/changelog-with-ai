# Changelog with AI

The terms "Changelog" and "Release Notes" are often used interchangeably, but they can have slightly different meanings depending on the context. Here's a general distinction between the two:

## Changelog: 
A changelog is a document or record that lists the changes made to a software application or system between different versions or releases. It typically provides a chronological account of bug fixes, feature additions, improvements, and any other modifications made to the software. A changelog is usually intended for developers, testers, and technical users who want detailed information about the changes in each version of the software. It often includes technical details such as code changes, API modifications, and other relevant information.

## Release Notes: 
Release notes, on the other hand, are a concise summary or document that highlights the key changes, improvements, and new features introduced in a software release. They are typically written for end-users, customers, or stakeholders who are interested in understanding the changes that affect their experience with the software. Release notes are often less technical and more user-oriented compared to changelogs. They may include information about new functionality, known issues, resolved bugs, important instructions, and any other relevant information that users need to be aware of.

In summary, a changelog provides a detailed account of all changes made to a software application, while release notes provide a high-level summary of the most important changes and updates in a particular software release.
